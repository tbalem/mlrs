# MLRS

MLRS is a personal project written in Rust that aims to provide a simple and straightforward tool for learning and training machine learning models.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to give me (the developer) a hands-on opportunity to learn more about the Rust language and to implement simple machine learning algorithms. Please note that while some standard libraries exist for the functionality implemented in this project, they have not been used deliberately in order to provide a learning experience for using Rust.

## Current functionality

At present, MLRS is not usable at all. Please note that this project is currently in a very early stage and is intended purely for learning and training purposes. The current implementation reads CSV files and allows filtering on columns, but it has some limitations such as using a `Vec` per row instead of per column. Additionally, the CSV reading functionality is being implemented as a training exercise and may be replaced by an external library in the future.

## Installation

To use MLRS, simply clone the repository and compile the code using Rust's standard build tools. You'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system in order to build and run the project.
